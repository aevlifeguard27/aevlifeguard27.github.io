        <h1>Abigail Vork</h1>
        <h2>Marketing Student, Lover of Jesus, Coffee Fanatic </h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Business Administration with a Marketing concentration. I have a desire to help nonprofits through Marketing/PR work.</p>
         <p>
            Get to know me! I grew up in Minnesota and love getting to experience all four seasons. I am an enneagram 1. I love coffee dates. My favorite colors are yellow and light pink, but I wear mostly gray and black. I drink my coffee black. I am always down to read a good book. Big, bustling cities make me so happy. I love road trips! Donuts are my favorite dessert, and I enjoy baking new recipes all the time. I am the queen of making lists.
         </p> 
         <p>
            Most of all, I am passionate about Jesus. I desire to shine the light of Jesus to those around me. 
         </p>
        
        <h3>Proverbs 3:5-6 - Trust in the Lord with all your heart
            and lean not on your own understanding;
            in all your ways submit to him,
                and he will make your paths straight.</h3>
       Love,<br>
